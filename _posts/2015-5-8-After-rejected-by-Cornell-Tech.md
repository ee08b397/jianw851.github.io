# Never say never

## Rejected
   I got a rejection letter from Cornell Tech this morning which ended my four-month waiting. I can't say I am sad while I can't say I am happy. I want to say many thing to Cornell Tech which I haven't had time to say. I have been working very hard on my academic courses and English skill improvement. Although having been taken charge on three software projects at work, I have used most my spare time finish reading an algorithm book, an English writing book, a C programing language book, an algorithm video course (except other courses unrelated to computer science such as Macro Economics) and do language exchange with a English native speaker twice a week in the last three months since I submitted my application of the program. Though I have learned most of the prerequisite courses such as: CS 2800, CS 4410, CS 2110, CS 1130, CS 3410, I would like review them again to make sure I can understand and use them. I believe I can do very well both on the courses and in the job with partners.
   Cornell Tech's unique master's program in CS which perfectly meet my requirement, but I failed. GPA seems the main reason though I had 7 years working exprience. I can understand that Cornell would never give admission to a student with GPA lower than 3.0 as a Ivy league member. 
    
## More space to improve 
   But everything has two side. If I got the chance to study and cooperate with world-class faculty in Cornell, would I succeed in the future? This result can only prove I don't have more advantages for educational oppotunities than local American students and high GPA students. I believe this is a good chance for me to improve my acdemic skills and I will work harder on them to get a better oppotunity to career life. Through this application, I found many good videos teach Tech innovation and startups on the Internet which shared by Cornell Tech faculties.such as [Christine Sneva's twitter](https://twitter.com/Christine_Sneva), [the next silicon valley](http://www.usnews.com/news/college-of-tomorrow/articles/2015/04/01/the-next-silicon-valley), [how to launch a successful company](http://tech.cornell.edu/news/4-lessons-from-david-tisch-on-how-to-launch-a-successful-company). In addtion, I found I am weak in Operating Systems and have a gap in Transition to Object-Oriented Programming. Failure is not the end, there is more space to improve.  
    
## In the future
   It's the time to make the decision. I think I will choose to study in Stevens Institue of Technology. Focus on big data or  cloud computing, keep on improving algorithm, enhance programing skills and creativity. Life is a long run, learn to love, learn to face, learn to cherish, learn to learn.
