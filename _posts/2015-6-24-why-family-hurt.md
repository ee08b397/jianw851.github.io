###Harmful behaviors between lovers

1. Guess: if your lover do what you think is wrong, do not guess

2. Judge: if you lover complain or anxious about something, don't judge it by your own view.

3. Give advise: if your lover ask you some question, do not immediately give advise.
       
        Tip: try to know your lovers feelings first, then accept and understand them. 

4. Don't bring your power outside to home
       
        Tips:divide work from family, family is the place where you should deal with gently and patiently. Keep your family members equal important and give respect to them. Cherish is the main theme of family.

###Important theories

1. Marital relationship is the core relationship of a family, it has the priority of all family relationships. If so, the family will be very stable. If mother-in-law husband relationship, father son relationship or mother son relationship become priority, everything will go wrong: 1.bad wife mother relationship. 2. Jocasta complex.家庭关系论：夫妻关系是家庭的核心，拥有第一发言权，那么这个家就会稳如磐石。如果公婆丈夫，父子，母子关系凌驾于夫妻关系之上，就会产生问题，1糟糕的婆媳关系 2 严重的恋子情结

2. If a mother want her baby grow healthy, she has to company her baby, interact with him/her, watch her baby with joy which is very important for him/her.妈妈与婴儿健康论：若以为妈妈想让你的孩子健康，在他婴幼儿时，多和他互动，看到他，并带着喜悦，是至关重要的。

3. Love and leave is the eternal theme of relationships, they are equally important. Psychologically leave one's parents is a long period, from childhood to adult, someone cannot leave until death.分离与爱理论：分离与爱同等重要，他们是生命中最重要的两个主题，他们一起作用，让一个人成长，让一个人成为他自己。与家的分离是一个漫长的过程，从幼儿园开始，到长大成人结束，有些人一辈子也完成不了这个过程。

4. Bert Hellinger Theroy 德国家庭治疗师：伯特.海灵格理论
  男孩在胎儿期和童年早期，主要受母亲的影响。如果他不能突破这种影响，母亲的影响就会充斥着他的心身。他会深深感受到母亲的力量和重要性。在母亲的影响下，他以后很可能成为一个感情骗子和调情高手，但他无法成长为一个珍惜女人并维持长久伴侣关系的男人，无法成为一个好爸爸，也无力维持一段平等的男女关系。他必须放弃那最原始，最亲密的对母亲的依附关系，去接受父亲的影响。
  Tips:男孩要归父亲，女孩要归母亲。即孩子要先向异性父母靠拢，并从这一关系中吸纳异性的力量，体会到自己对异性的吸引力，同时体验到异性对他的吸引力。然后男孩回到男性世界，成为一个男人，女孩回到女性的世界，成为一个女人。只有这样，他们的心理才更健康，而这个世界，才更和谐。

5. About Soul
 看不到灵魂的存在，就不知道自己的尊贵。对爱的追求不能以物质的形式而存在，而是认识到灵魂的存在。


###What is wrong with Chinese way of love and family

1. 中国式溺爱：限制了自己的自由，一个人为自己而活着的时候才是最有力量的。溺爱是温柔的陷阱。看到孩子真实的存在，发现孩子真实需要，并帮助孩子实现他的需要，这便是真爱。

2. 成熟的父母不会在第一时间处理孩子的问题，他们会先处理孩子的感受。

3. 复读中需要解决的不是知识水平问题，而是心理问题。

4. 如果总是一帆风顺，那一个人的思维容易陷入单向度思维，对事情的考虑容易片面；如果一个人总是遭受挫折，那么这个人的思维也容易陷入单向度思维。

5. 中国人有七成至八成的婚姻都是建立在安全感的基础上的，婚姻安全感的最高境界是彼此成了亲人，因为亲人是不会离开你的，想起他就很亲切，但实际上也很少想起他。

6. 关于安全感，中国人有单一的物质化界定，比如房子，车子。没有房子就不结婚，所以说，丈母娘推动了中国的房价。爱情还是物质，这种选择题的出发点就是错误的，为什么不能先有爱情然后再有物质条件呢？中国人总是在劝那些在婚姻关系中没有爱情的人，别贪心，不可能得到一切。他们一定不会将爱情放在特别重要的位置，但是真正能够制造安全感的只有爱。

###My thoughts

1. I am very happy that most of my life have been going in the comparably right way, However, there are some big mistakes still caused unhealthy problem in my deep soul.

2. I am lucky that I have made a lot of male friends since I attended in middle school which formed my personality especially my sexal preference, and I appreciate my parents send me to a better middle school far away from home which I could totally seperate from family conflict, thus, give me enough time to focus on study rather than feel guilty of being disable to fix family relationships.

3. I have been effected by my mom's limited recognitions and experiences for a long time since she always anxious about every detail of my life due to her absence and guilty. She always use a wrong way to express her love in order to make herself feel better. So I have never been risky and spirital independent until I  got finacially freedom recently. Self-abasement has convolved me as a ghost for nearly 30 years. I hate ignorance and extreme conservative empiricism.

4. Today, I am happy that I am a totally independent individule. A new epic is beginning.
