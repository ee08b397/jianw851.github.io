   Today is a big day for me, I was approved for my F1 visa. I can't say I am lucky, because everything that I have done was granted. And based on this thinking, instead of rejoice, I feel so tired that it costed me so long to get everthing right on the way, and this is just the begining of my new choice.

###Milestone

From now on, I don't need to take GRE, TOEFL test any more, don't have to pracitse spoken English with foriegners third time a week, don't have to worry about my application being rejected, and don't need to be anxious to borrow money for finacial qualification. Thus, the new epic is beginning, where there is no constrain of culture unity, no discrimination of human value, no critics of individual character development, no judgement of personal behavior, no opacity of leadership election. What I should do is focus on what I would like to do and what I want to be. I call it freedom, happiness, and health which is the original power of human life. 

###What next

There are four goals in my year of 2015, they are: learn to face, learn to love, learn to cherish, learn to learn. I think I have done facing directly to my departure from my former job, and deal with relationship between me and my colleges. I love all the people appear in my life, who helped me, love me, like me, hate me, hurt me which composed my experience, formlessly developed me. I cherish the relationship with my girl, who is my best love ever in the world. Without her, I cannot reach to the goal which I have already achieved. Without her, I couldn't be the person who firmly belief there is hope and love in the world. I will give her the best understanding, caring, responsebility, respect, suport and lovein the world. Finally, it is education which rebuild my confidence to study, to human connection, to the objective world, so I will focus on the method of learning to make my world being sustainable to be excellent.
